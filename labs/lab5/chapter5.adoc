# OpenShift templates and web console

OpenShift contains docker as well as Kubernetes layers to cater for the container runtime and orchestration of containers.
OpenShift however caters for more than simple container orchestration. As such customers take their container images and improt these into the OpenShift platform.

In this lab we introduce how to simplify your container deployments with OpenShift templates.  We will also explore the web console.

This lab should be performed on **YOUR ASSIGNED AWS VM** as `ec2-user` unless otherwise instructed.

Expected completion: 20 minutes

## Project preparation

Step 1:: Login to our local OpenShift.
----
$ oc login -u developer
You have one project on this server: "myproject"
----

You are now logged in to OpenShift and are using the ```devel``` project. You can also view the OpenShift web console by using the same credentials to log in to ```https://<YOUR AWS VM PUBLIC DNS NAME HERE>:8443``` in a browser.

Projects are an extention of the Kubernetes namespace, these projects can be used a administrative and permission boundries.

Step 2:: Let's create a new project:
----
$ oc new-project production
Now using project "devel" on server "https://127.0.0.1:8443".
----


## Wordpress templated deployment

During the setup phase a wordpress and mariadb container were build and pushed to a local container repo running on port 5000.
A template will be used to deploy these to OpenShift.


Feel free to view the full template.
----
$ cd ~/openshift-on-aws/labs/lab5/
$ grep localhost:5000 wordpress-template.yaml
----

You will note the application spec containing all the appliction details as well as the image being pulled from the local container repo.

Step 3:: Let's deploy this wordpress template by adding your template to the production project
----
$ oc create -f wordpress-template.yaml
template "wordpress" created
----

Step 4:: Deploy your new template with "oc new-app" and note its output
----
$ oc new-app --template wordpress
--> Deploying template "production/wordpress" to project production
----

Step 5:: View all of the newly created resources
----
$ oc get all
----

You can confirm the state of the application roll out:

----
$ oc rollout status -w dc/mariadb
$ oc rollout status -w dc/wordpress
----

You should see something like:
----
replication controller "mariadb-1" successfully rolled out
replication controller "wordpress-1" successfully rolled out
----

Step 6:: Verify the database started
----
$ oc logs dc/mariadb
----

expected output: mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /var/lib/mysql

Step 7:: Verify wordpress started
----
$ oc logs dc/wordpress
----

Expected outpiut: /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND

Step 8:: view of how these resources connect using oc status
----
$ oc status
----

Step 9:: Check and make sure you can access the wordpress service through it's route:
----
$ oc get routes
$ curl -L wordpress-production.<YOUR AWS VM PUBLIC IP>.nip.io
----

* Or open the URL in a browser to view the UI

OpenShift includes several ready-made templates. Let's take a look at some of them:
----
$ oc get templates -n openshift
----

For more information on templates, reference the official OpenShift documentation:

## Web console

Now that we have deployed our template, let’s login as developer to the OpenShift web console - `https://<YOUR AWS VM PUBLIC DNS NAME HERE>:8443`

Step 10:: Get OpenShift console URL:
----
$ oc cluster status
----

Login to the web console with the `developer` user.

And after we’ve logged in, we see a list of projects that the developer user has access to. Let's select the `production` project:

Our project landing page provides us with a high-level overview of our wordpress application's pods, services, and route:

OpenShift takes you by default to the *Overview* page and shows you a graphic representation of the application that is deployed here. You can see that a single pod is running and is front ended by a service. Note the route that you
configured for this service is also shown. You will also see the *Add to
Project* button on the top. This can be used to create new application
from Web Console inside this project.

Let's dive a little deeper. We want to view a list of our pods by clicking on `Pods` in the left Applications menu:

image::4.png[Add Secrets4]


Next, let's click on one of our running pods for greater detail:

With this view, we have access to pod information like status, logs, image, volumes, and more:

Select *Builds* under *Builds* tab, you will see all the build
configurations. Click onto each build configuration and select the
*Configuration* tab, we will be able to view all the build details.

image::project_build_details.png[image]

Select *Pods* under *Applications* tab, you will find a running pod that
is running your application image. Note that it also tells you the node
on which the pod is running and other details about this pod. You will
also see the build pod that had succeeded.

Click onto running pod, it shows the details on the pod. In addition,
metrics, logs and terminal also available for monitoring.

image::project_pod_details.png[image]

Click on *Terminal* tab, you will be able to access the pod from web
console.

If you click onto the *Metrics* tab under Pod and get an error viewing
metrics on the browser, please do the following:

1.  Open link for the Hawkular webpage from a new tab on the same broswer
2.  Click ``Advanced'' link
3.  Click ``Proceed to hawkular.<> (unsafe)''
4.  Refresh the browser where you login at OpenShift console.

Click *Builds* on left menu and select *Builds*. Select the build name
*time* and then click on *Configuration* tab. Note there are webhook
URLs. We will use them in a later lab exercise. You can start a build
from the Web Console by pressing the *Start Build* button in the right
top corner. It also gives you a command to start the build from CLI.

* Select *Services* under *Applications* tab, you will find the service
created for your application. Click onto one of the services, it shows
all the details about the service along with the option to expose it as
a route.
* Select *Routes* under *Applications* tab, you will see all the routes
in the project. Click onto a route, it shows all the details for this
route.
* Select *Deployments* under *Applications* tab, you will see all the
deployments. Click onto a deployment, it shows all the details of the
deployment. By pressing the *Deploy* button, you will be able to start a
deployment from the web console.
* Select *Monitoring* tab, you will see all the events for the project.
Also latest events grouped by resource type.
* Select *Images* under *Builds* tab, it shows the list of image streams
for the project. Click onto the specific image stream, it shows more
details about the image stream.

Click on the *Resources* tab on the left to see that it would display
the Quotas and Other Resources, if they exist. We will deal with them in
a different lab exercise.

Feel free to continue exploring the console.

In the final lab you'll get to play with some new features, the service catalog and broker.
