# Using .Net and PostgreSQL Template

:data-uri:

In this lab exercise we will learn how to use OpenShift Web Console to
spin up a PostgreSQL database and .Net application using templates.
We can spin up both .Net and database tier at the same time. The .Net
application accesses this database using the service exposed by
the database. We will provide a route (a URL) to access the frontend
application from a browser.

Step 1:: Using the browser, create a new project named dotnet-userName*

Step 2:: Create a .Net application using the template*

Click on *Add to Project* button and you will be taken to select an
image or template. 

Click select the '.Net Core + PostgreSQL(Persistent)' template.

Click the *Next* button, then populate the following fields accordingly:

....
Name : musicstore
Git URL: https://github.com/piggyvenus/s2i-aspnet-musicstore-ex.git
Database Username: myuser
Database Password: password
Database Name: sampledb
....
Click *Next* and then 
Click *Create*.

After the build is completed, click on the route to display the application.

In this lab exercise you have seen a complete web application deployed
using OpenShift templates. We are able to deploy application via templates.
Using template, we can capture all the information that it require to deploy
application in one step.
